      <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
      <h5>Last Updated: February 2024</h5>
      <p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN SECTION 11. PLEASE READ THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.</p>
      <p>Consensys Software Inc. (“Consensys,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the leading blockchain software development company. With a focus on utilizing decentralized technologies, such as Ethereum, our software is powering a revolution in commerce and finance and helping to optimize business processes. Consensys hosts a top level domain website, https://consensys.io/, that serves information regarding Consensys and our products and services (collectively, the “Offerings”), as well as sub-domains for our products or services (the top level domain with the sub-domains collectively referred to as the “Site”), which include text, images, audio, code and other materials or third party information.</p>
      <p>hese Terms of Use, including their appendix (the “Terms,” “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”) contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Site and Offerings provided by us and is an agreement between us and you or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”). Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using the Site or Offerings. By using the Site, clicking a button or checkbox to accept or agree to these Terms where that option is made available, clicking a button to use or access any of the Offerings, completing an Order, or, if earlier, using or otherwise accessing the Offerings (the date on which any of the events listed above occur being the “Effective Date”), you (1) accept and agree to these Terms and any additional terms that apply to certain Additional Offerings (as defined below), rules and conditions of participation issued by Consensys from time to time and (2) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms or perform any and all obligations you accept under the Terms, then you may not access or use the Offerings.</p>
      <p>You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts. If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 13 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.</p>
      <p>In addition, you represent to us that you are (1) not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Government (i.e., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, the United Kingdom, or other applicable government authority and (2) not located in any country subject to a comprehensive sanctions program implemented by the United States.</p>
      <p>1. The Offerings.<br/>
        1.1 Generally. You may access and use the Offerings only in accordance with this Agreement. You agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Offerings. </p>
      <p>1.2 Offerings and Access. Consensys offers a number of Offerings under the Consensys brand or brands owned by us. These include Infura, MetaMask and others. Offerings are generally accessed through the Site or through a third party provider of which we approved, such as the Google Play or Apple App stores, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Some Offerings may require you to create an account with Consensys, enter a valid form of payment, and select a paid plan (a “Paid Plan”), or initiate an Order.</p>
      <p>1.3 Third-Party Content and Services. In certain Offerings, including MetaMask Swaps, Bridging, Staking, and Snaps, you may view, have access to, and may use the informational content, products, or services of one or more third parties (“Third Party Content” and “Third Party Services” respectively). In each such case, you agree that you view, access or use such content and services at your own election. Your reliance on any Third Party Content and use of Third Party Services in connection with the Offerings is governed on one hand by this Agreement but, on the other, will also generally be subject to separate terms and conditions set forth by the applicable third party content and/or service provider. Those terms and conditions may involve separate fees and charges or may include disclaimers or risk warnings about reliance on or the accuracy of any information. Such terms may also apply a privacy policy different than that which Consensys maintains and incorporates into this Agreement. It is your responsibility to understand the terms and conditions of Third Party Services, including how those service providers use any of your information under their privacy policies.</p>
      <p>Third Party Content and Third Party Services are provided for your convenience only. We do not verify, curate, or control Third Party Content. We do not control Third Party Services. As a result, we do not guarantee, endorse, or recommend such content or services to any or all users of the Offerings, or the use of such content or services for any particular purpose. You access, rely upon or use any Third Party Content or Third Party Service at your own risk. Consensys disclaims all responsibility and liability for any Losses on account of your reliance upon or use of such content or services. We have no responsibility for Third Party Content that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable to you or under the law in your jurisdiction. The choice to rely on Third Party Content or to use a Third Party Service is your own, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that your reliance or use is in compliance with all applicable laws. Dealing or correspondence with any third party that provides such content or services is solely between you and that third party. We reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, disable, or impose access restrictions or limits on the use of any Third Party Service at any time without notice.</p>
      <p>1.4 Support. You may seek or receive technical or product support, information, advice, or guidance from us regarding the Offerings, including via third party service provider, chat interface, or email. All support made available or provided by or on behalf of Consensys is believed to be reliable, but we do not make representations or warranties, express or implied, as to its accuracy, its completeness, or the results to be obtained. Such support is being provided for informational purposes only and, by accepting such support, you are representing that you have adequate skill and experience regarding the proper selection, use, and/or application of Offerings and use such Offerings at your own discretion and risk. With the exception of instances of gross negligence, you hold us harmless for any injury that may result from the support you receive from us. You are aware that our customer support efforts may be impersonated by malicious third parties, and you agree that we are not responsible for the actions of such impersonators. You further acknowledge that we will not offer support via SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, or Twitter DMs, and that we will never ask you for your private key or secret recovery phrase or for you to make a payment to us.</p>
      <p>2. Changes.<br>
        2.1 To the Offerings. We may change or discontinue any or all of the Offerings or change or remove functionality of any or all of the Offerings from time to time. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of an Offering through the Site or public communication channels. If you are on a Paid Plan, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of the Offering at least 30 days in advance of such discontinuation, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue supporting the Offering for up to three months after the discontinuation, except if doing so (a) would pose an information security or intellectual property issue, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) would create undue risk of us violating the law. </p>
      <p>2.2 To this Agreement. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement or any Policies at any time. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes, but we will also use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate any material changes to this Agreement through the Site, email (if you have an account), or public channels. You agree that your continued use of or access to the Offerings following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes, whether or not you were checking for changes or actually read the changes.</p>
      <p>3. Your Responsibilities.<br>
        3.1 Use of the Offerings. For any Offerings, whether they require that you set up an account with Consensys (such as Diligence) or they do not (such as MetaMask), and except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur with respect to your use of the Offerings, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or other End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Offerings or your account, including any access that occurred as a result of fraud, phishing, or other criminal activity perpetrated against you by third parties. You will ensure that your use of the Offerings does not violate any applicable law. </p>
      <p>3.2 Your Security and Backup. You are solely responsible for properly configuring and using the Offerings and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect, and backup your accounts and/or Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption. If you are not able to be responsible for your own account security, or do not want such an obligation, then you should not use the Offerings. Your obligations under this Agreement include ensuring any available software updates or upgrades to an Offering you are using are promptly installed or implemented, and recording and securely maintaining any passwords or secret recovery phrases that relate to your use of the Offerings. You acknowledge that certain methods of securing your secret recovery phrase, such as storing it as a digital file anywhere, including on your personal device or on a cloud storage provider, increase the risk that your account or secret recovery phrase will be compromised. You further acknowledge that you will not share with us nor any other third party any password or secret recovery phrase that relates to your use of the Offerings, and that we will not be held responsible if you do share any such password or phrase, whether you do so knowingly or unknowingly. For the avoidance of doubt, we take no responsibility whatsoever for any theft of a secret recovery phrase that involved intrusion through any means into your personal device or a cloud provider’s data repository.</p>
      <p>3.3 Log-In Credentials and API Authentication. To the extent we provide you with log-in credentials and API authentication generated by the Offerings, such log-in credentials and API authentication are for your use only and you will not sell, transfer, or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your password or private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.</p>
