                                    any liability to you and deny any obligations to indemnify or hold you harmless for any
                                    losses you may incur as a result
                                    of fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets. Smart
                                    contracts execute automatically when certain
                                    conditions are met. We do not have the ability to reverse a transaction that is recorded
                                    on a public blockchain.
                                    You are responsible for ensuring that any details entered you enter in connection with a
                                    transaction using any
                                    smart contracts are accurate and complete. We are not responsible for any losses due to
                                    your errors, including an
                                    incorrectly constructed transaction. Further, since smart contracts typically cannot be
                                    stopped or reversed,
                                    vulnerabilities in their programming and design or other vulnerabilities that may arise
                                    due to hacking or other security
                                    incidents can have adverse effects to digital assets, including but not limited to
                                    significant volatility and risk of loss.</p>
